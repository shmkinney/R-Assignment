# R assignment Review from Urval Patel

## Data Inspection/Processing

-   Data inspection/processing codes look good. Somehow I cannot see the output of this files on github just markdown file

## Data visualization

-   I am not sure whether professor asked for Centromere vs density graph. Otherthan that every snippets of code ran smoothly
